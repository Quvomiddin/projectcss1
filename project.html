                 <p>Graphic designers are often responsible for creating designs for marketing and advertising materials. 
                It’s a bit of a broad title for an often broad position. People in these roles can design for a wide range of platforms and create visual content for print,
                digital and mobile formats.
                At the highest level, graphic designers are responsible for creating 2D visual assets that effectively convey information. it wouldn’t be unusual to find a graphic designer who has focused on a particular type of work in a specific medium,
                such as marketing collateral for print.</p>

                <p>Interaction designers focus on how users interact with products and use principles of good communication to create desired user experiences.
                The term “interaction design” is sometimes used interchangeably with “user experience design.”
                That’s understandable because there’s a huge overlap between interaction design and UX design. After all,
                UX design is about shaping the experience of using a product, and a major part of that experience involves interaction between the user and the product.
                But interaction design and user experience aren’t synonymous.</p>

                <p>My 20 year career has taken me from software development to UX, and now into areas like strategic / service / systemic design though they’re still a bit fuzzy to me. 
                    I’ve line-managed others but felt it wasn’t my calling, so I chose to be an individual contributor (IC), spending more time tackling messy problems. Some organisations support IC role tracks,
                     and I’m currently a senior principal designer on my organisation’s IC track.
